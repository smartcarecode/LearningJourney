Exploring the exciting field of cybersecurity and learning why cybersecurity is a future-proof career.

👩‍⚕️ Background

With over 7 years of experience in healthcare, I have developed a deep appreciation for data privacy, system integrity, and the critical need to protect sensitive information. Working in high-stakes environments has shaped my understanding of risk, compliance, and operational security—foundational principles that directly translate to cybersecurity.

Before starting my Cisco studies, I completed all modules of the ISC² Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) course. However, I have not yet appeared for the exam as I found it quite challenging. I am taking time to grasp the concepts more deeply, build greater confidence, and develop better command of the material before attempting the exam.

🧭 Transition Journey

I am committed to learning cybersecurity with humility, discipline, and a growth mindset. Instead of rushing through certifications, I focus on gaining deep understanding and practical skills that will enable me to contribute meaningfully in the field.
