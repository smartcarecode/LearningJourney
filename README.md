# ISC2 NOTES

## üåü Progress Update: Today‚Äôs Learning Achievement

Today, I dedicated focused time to deeply study and understand the **CIA Triad** ‚Äî the core foundation of information security.  
This principle of **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability** is vital for protecting data in any environment.

I‚Äôm excited to have grasped these concepts clearly, and I‚Äôm committed to building on this knowledge every day.  
This marks an important step in my journey toward becoming a skilled cybersecurity professional.

Continuous learning and growth are my priorities, and I‚Äôm motivated to keep pushing forward with discipline and passion.

# üîê The CIA Triad: Fundamental Principles of Information Security

The **CIA Triad** defines the three core goals to protect information systems:

- **Confidentiality:** Keep data private and secure.  
- **Integrity:** Ensure data is accurate and trustworthy.  
- **Availability:** Make data and systems accessible when needed.

---

## üîí Confidentiality

1. Grant access **only to authorized users**.  
2. Block **unauthorized access** effectively.  
3. Use **strong passwords** and **multi-factor authentication**.  
4. Protect data with **encryption**.  
5. Limit access based on **user roles**.  
6. Train employees on **data privacy best practices**.  
7. Log and monitor **data access activities**.  
8. Label sensitive data as **confidential**.  
9. Avoid sharing data over **public or unsecured networks**.  
10. Ensure policies prevent **data leakage or exposure**.

**Example:** Nurses can view patient records; cleaning staff cannot.

---

## üßæ Integrity

1. Maintain data **accuracy and consistency**.  
2. Prevent **unauthorized data modifications**.  
3. Use tools to **detect changes or tampering**.  
4. Keep detailed **logs of all data changes**.  
5. Perform **regular backups**.  
6. Allow edits by **trusted personnel only**.  
7. Regularly check data for **errors or inconsistencies**.  
8. Follow strict **change control procedures**.  
9. Use **digital signatures** for data verification.  
10. Verify data sources to ensure **authenticity**.

**Example:** Lab results remain unaltered unless properly updated.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Availability

1. Ensure systems and data are **accessible when needed**.  
2. Resolve issues **promptly to reduce downtime**.  
3. Use **backup systems** to maintain service during failures.  
4. Perform regular **system maintenance and updates**.  
5. Defend against attacks that **disrupt service**.  
6. Monitor system health for early issue detection.  
7. Maintain **backup power sources** like generators.  
8. Prepare **disaster recovery plans**.  
9. Design systems to support **high user demand**.  
10. Protect hardware from **damage or theft**.

**Example:** Hospital IT systems run continuously, 24/7.

# Privacy and Data Protection Overview

Understanding privacy and data protection is essential in today‚Äôs digital world. Personal data must be handled responsibly to protect individuals and comply with laws.

---

## What is Privacy?

- **Control over personal information** such as names, emails, and online activity  
- Determines who can **access, use, or share** your data

---

## Privacy vs. Security

| Aspect   | Description                                     |
|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Privacy** | Control over who accesses and uses data       |
| **Security**| Protects data from unauthorized access & threats |

---

## Important Privacy Laws

- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ‚Äì 2016**  
  Applies globally to companies handling EU residents‚Äô data  
  _Example:_ Facebook complies with GDPR for EU users

- **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) ‚Äì 2018**  
  Protects California residents‚Äô data rights  
  _Example:_ Google follows CCPA rules for California users

---

## Global Compliance

- Organizations must follow privacy laws based on where their users live  
- Ensures responsible data handling across different regions

---

## Risks of Non-Compliance

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Heavy fines (up to millions of dollars or euros)  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal actions and lawsuits  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Loss of customer trust and damage to reputation

---

## Summary

- Privacy gives people control over their personal data  
- Security protects data but doesn‚Äôt guarantee privacy alone  
- Laws like GDPR and CCPA enforce responsible data use  
- Compliance helps avoid penalties and build trust
