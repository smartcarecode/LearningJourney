# Non-Repudiation

---

## Overview

Non-repudiation is a crucial security principle that ensures a person or entity **cannot deny** having performed a specific digital action. It provides **undeniable proof** of data origin and delivery, making it impossible to falsely deny involvement in transactions or communications.

With the rise of electronic transactions and digital communication, non-repudiation builds trust, enforces accountability, and supports legal compliance.

---

## Why Non-Repudiation Matters

In digital systems, actions happen remotely and quickly. Without non-repudiation, users could deny their actions, leading to fraud, disputes, and legal issues.

**Non-repudiation helps to:**

- Protect all parties by providing clear evidence of actions  
- Reduce fraud and impersonation  
- Enforce electronic contracts and agreements  
- Build confidence in digital platforms  

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Prevents Denial  
Stops users from denying digital actions (e.g., online purchases).

### 2. Legal Evidence  
Digital signatures and logs serve as evidence in courts.

### 3. Action Tracking  
Logs record who did what and when, creating an audit trail.

### 4. Identity Verification  
Digital signatures and certificates confirm true user identities.

### 5. Builds Trust and Accountability  
Makes digital actions traceable and verifiable, increasing trust.

---

## Common Applications

- **Digital Signatures:** Authenticate and verify documents and messages  
- **Online Transactions:** Record payment details to prevent fraud  
- **Secure Email:** Verify sender authenticity using cryptographic signatures  
- **Audit Logs:** Track user activity for compliance and forensic analysis  
- **E-Government Services:** Ensure transparency and legal integrity in citizen requests  

---

## How Non-Repudiation Works

Non-repudiation typically relies on:

- **Cryptographic Techniques:** Digital signatures and hashing ensure integrity and authenticity  
- **Timestamping:** Records the exact time of actions  
- **Authentication Mechanisms:** Strong identity verification (passwords, biometrics, certificates)  
- **Audit Trails:** Detailed logs for future verification  

---

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Key Management:** Secure storage and handling of cryptographic keys  
- **System Integrity:** Prevent tampering with logs and signatures

A well-prepared **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)** helps organizations:

- Continue critical functions during disruptions
- Communicate effectively with stakeholders
- Recover quickly and minimize operational impact

---

## 📋 Key Objectives of Business Continuity

### 1. ✅ Sustain Operations During Disruptions
When an event disturbs the normal environment (e.g., a cyberattack or power outage), the goal is to **maintain core business functions** while the situation is being addressed.

### 2. 📞 Communication is Critical
Effective communication is a cornerstone of business continuity. The BCP should include:

- Multiple **contact methodologies** (email, mobile, satellite, radio, etc.)
- **Backup contact numbers** in case of communication system failures
- Procedures to **initiate communication** immediately after a disruption

---

## 🧑‍💼 Activating the Plan

The **first step** after a disruption is to **notify the appropriate individuals** and begin activating the business continuity plan.

### Important Considerations:

- **Involve management**: Situational awareness and shifting priorities require decision-makers.
- Ensure the presence of **authorized personnel** to execute key actions (e.g., shutting down critical systems or departments).
- **Access emergency contacts**:
  - Supply chain contacts
  - Law enforcement
  - Off-site facilities or backup locations

---

## 🏥 Real-World Example: Cyberattack on a Hospital

> A hospital experiences a severe cyberattack that disrupts:
> - Internet access
> - Internal communications (e.g., pharmacy systems)
> - Phone lines

In the U.S., during major cyberattacks that disable communication infrastructure, **military-grade communication networks** (like FirstNet) can be used. These are:

- Pre-assigned to **authorized personnel**
- Used in **critical infrastructure sectors** (e.g., healthcare, emergency services)
- Essential for **maintaining critical services** in extreme situations

---

## 🌲 Phone Trees & Contact Chains

# ⚠️ The Goal of Disaster Recovery

**Disaster Recovery (DR)** refers specifically to restoring the **information technology (IT)** and **communications systems** an organization needs to function after a disruptive event.

### 🔧 Key Objectives:

- Restore IT and communication services during and after a disaster
- Support the recovery of business operations through technological restoration
- Transition from disruption back to **last-known reliable operations**

---

## 🆚 Business Continuity vs. Disaster Recovery

| Aspect | Business Continuity | Disaster Recovery |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Focus** | Maintain critical business functions | Restore IT and communication systems |
| **Timing** | During the disruption | After the disruption |
| **Scope** | Organization-wide | Technology-focused |
| **Goal** | Keep business running | Return to full operational status |

**Note:** While business functions may resume temporarily through workarounds, disaster recovery ensures the full restoration of IT systems that support those functions.

---

## 📘 The Role of the Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

The **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)** guides emergency response teams through the process of:

1. **Responding** to the incident or disaster
2. **Restoring** affected systems, applications, and communications
3. **Recovering** data and configurations
4. **Returning** the business to normal, reliable operations

Disaster recovery planning steps in **after** the initial business continuity efforts, ensuring that temporary solutions are replaced with full system functionality.

---

## 🎯 End Goal

> To restore **full, reliable operations** of IT and communications infrastructure, enabling the organization to return to its pre-disruption state.
>
> # 💥 Disaster Recovery in the Real World

Disaster recovery isn't just a theoretical exercise—it requires **real-world readiness** for complex and sometimes delayed incidents. Critical systems, backup strategies, and system interdependencies must all be accounted for to avoid catastrophic data loss and operational shutdown.

---

## 🔍 Importance of Early Detection

In many real-world cases:

- Incidents are **not discovered immediately**.
- **Days, weeks, or even months** can pass before signs of compromise appear.
- This delay can result in backups containing **malware or corrupted data**, making recovery far more complex.

> 🔎 **Real-World Example:**  
> A hospital in Los Angeles discovered a data compromise **260 days** (~8.5 months) after the initial breach.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways for Real-World DR Planning

### 1. ✅ Identify Critical Systems
Ensure all critical systems are:

- Formally documented
- Mapped to their dependencies
- Included in recovery testing scenarios

> Backing up individual servers isn't enough—you must understand how systems interact.

---

### 2. 🗃️ Backup More Than Just the Server

Disaster recovery must consider:

- The **entire database structure**
- All **application-level dependencies**
- **Inter-system communication paths** (e.g., message queues, APIs, sync routines)

---

## 🏥 Real-World Healthcare Example

### Hospital System Dependencies:

In a hospital environment:

- The **radiology** and **laboratory** departments used **separate systems**.
- Patient data originated in the **registration system** and was copied into both the radiology and laboratory systems.
- Each system used **separate databases**.
- A **sync routine** handled data transfers between systems.

> 🔄 This complex data flow means that a simple server-level restore could **fail** if these dependencies are not fully understood.

---

## 🛑 When Backups Contain Malware

In one real-world scenario:

- A hospital was attacked with **time-based malware**.
- The malware lay dormant in backups and only triggered upon restoration.
- As a result, the hospital had to:
  - Go back nearly **a year** to find a clean, pre-infection backup
  - **Manually restore data** piece-by-piece to avoid reinfection

### 🔁 Lessons Learned:

- **Multiple levels of backup** are essential (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly snapshots)
- Implement **longer retention periods**
- Backups must be **regularly tested** for integrity and malware contamination

---

## 📌 Summary

Disaster recovery in complex environments requires:

- A deep understanding of **system architecture**
- Planning for **data flow and cross-system dependencies**
- **Regular backup testing**
- **Threat modeling** that includes dormant and delayed threats

> _"A backup is only as good as your ability to restore it—safely and completely."_

---

# 🚀 Business Continuity in Action

Imagine a scenario where the **billing department of a company suffers a complete loss due to a fire**. The fire occurred overnight, so no personnel were present at the time.

---

## 🔍 Background

- A **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** was performed four months earlier.
- The BIA identified the billing department’s functions as **very important**, but not immediately critical to other departments.
- The company has a **pre-arranged agreement** for an alternate workspace that can be made available in **less than one week**.

---

## 🛠️ Response & Recovery Actions

- While the alternate area is being prepared, **customer billing inquiries are handled by the customer service team**.
- Billing department personnel relocate to the alternate workspace and remain there until a new permanent area is ready.
- The company’s **ample cash reserves** make a one-week interruption in billing acceptable.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- The **dependencies between billing, customer inquiries, and revenue** were identified during the BIA.
- Pre-planning enabled the company to **quickly activate an alternate workspace** and temporarily reassign customer service duties.
- Thanks to these preparations and the execution of the business continuity plan, **there was no significant interruption** to business operations or customer service.

---

## 💡 What Does Business Continuity Look Like in Action?

This example illustrates how **proactive planning, clear analysis, and coordinated execution** ensure that even unexpected disasters **do not derail critical business functions**.

---
# 🛠️ Components of a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

# Domain 3: Access Control Concepts

# Security Controls

Security controls are safeguards or countermeasures designed to preserve the **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability** of data — collectively known as the **CIA Triad**.

---

## What is a Security Control?

A security control limits access and actions by defining which subjects (users, processes) can interact with which objects (data, resources) under specific rules.

---

## Examples of Security Controls

### Access Control

Access control involves limiting what objects are available to what subjects according to defined policies or rules. It ensures that only authorized users or processes can access certain resources.

### Firewall

A firewall is a network security control that:

- **Blocks unauthorized external access:** Prevents potentially harmful traffic from entering and compromising the internal system or network.
- **Prevents data leakage:** Stops sensitive internal information from leaving the network and being accessed by unauthorized parties on the internet.

---

## Summary

Security controls are essential tools to maintain the security posture of any system by enforcing the CIA Triad principles:

- **Confidentiality:** Keeping data private.
- **Integrity:** Ensuring data accuracy and reliability.
- **Availability:** Making sure data and resources are accessible when needed.

---

*This document provides a brief overview of security controls with a focus on access control and firewalls.*

# Controls Overview

Access control is often considered the **heart of an information security program**. Security ultimately depends on **who** can access organizational assets (buildings, data, systems) and **what** they can do with that access.

Access controls are not just about restricting access; they also ensure that **authorized subjects** get the **appropriate level of access** while denying unauthorized access.

---

## Core Elements of Access Control

Access control relies on three key components:

- **Subjects**  
- **Rules**  
- **Objects**

---

### Subjects

A subject is any **active entity** that requests access to assets. Examples include:

- Users  
- Processes  
- Programs  
- Devices (workstations, smartphones, USB drives)

Subjects initiate requests and must have permissions or clearance to access resources.

---

### Objects

An object is anything a subject attempts to access. Objects are **passive** and respond to requests. Examples include:

- Files, databases  
- Devices like printers or scanners  
- Servers or software processes  
- Physical assets like buildings

Objects have owners who define access permissions, usually enforced by rules.

---

### Rules

Rules define the logic that determines if a subject can access an object and under what conditions. They:

- Compare subject identities and attributes to access policies  
- Allow or deny access  
- Specify levels of access (read, write, execute)  
- May include conditions like time-based access restrictions

Example: Firewall rules allowing traffic from trusted IP addresses.

---

## How Access Control Works

1. A **subject** requests access to an **object**.  
2. A **rule** evaluates the request based on identity and permissions.  
3. Access is either granted or denied accordingly.

This framework secures systems by controlling who can do what, and when.

---

## Summary

Access control ensures that organizational resources are protected by:

- Granting the right access to authorized subjects  
- Denying unauthorized access  
- Applying consistent policies across systems  

Understanding **subjects**, **rules**, and **objects** is essential for building secure access control models.

---

*Access control is not just about denying access—it’s about enabling the right access at the right time.*


# Defense in Depth

**Defense in Depth** is a layered security strategy that integrates **people**, **technology**, and **operations** to create multiple barriers protecting an organization's assets. These layers work together to deter or prevent cyberattacks by applying various countermeasures across different points of vulnerability.

---

## What is Defense in Depth?

Defense in depth involves implementing **multiple layers of controls** across various domains of an organization, including:

- Physical access (e.g., buildings, server rooms)  
- Network and system access  
- Applications and utilities  

This strategy ensures that if one layer is breached, other layers continue to provide protection.

> *Note: While defense in depth reduces risk, it does not guarantee complete prevention of attacks.*

---

## Examples of Defense in Depth

### Technical Controls

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  
  Requires a combination of credentials, such as:
  - Something you **know** (password)  
  - Something you **have** (verification code sent to a phone)  
  This layered approach significantly increases security over single-factor authentication.

- **Multiple Firewalls:**  
  Using several firewalls to segment networks based on trust levels. For example:  
  - One firewall separates the internet (untrusted network) from the organization's internal network.  
  - Additional firewalls protect sensitive servers behind stricter rules.

### Physical Controls

- Locked doors restricting access to data centers.
- Security personnel monitoring entry points.
- Surveillance cameras and badge access systems.

### Administrative Controls

- Policies that define who is authorized to access sensitive areas or data.
- Procedures for granting, reviewing, and revoking access permissions.

---

## Applying Defense in Depth to Asset Protection

When protecting assets with different sensitivity levels, organizations often implement multiple overlapping controls:

| Control Type         | Example                                    |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Physical Controls** | Locked doors, security guards              |
| **Logical/Technical** | Firewalls, multi-factor authentication    |
| **Administrative**   | Access policies, user training             |

For example, accessing data in a data center might require:

1. Physical entry through a locked door  
2. Network access through controlled firewall rules  
3. Authorization based on administrative policies  

---

## Summary

Defense in depth is about building **redundant layers of protection** that address diverse risks and vulnerabilities. This layered approach enhances overall security posture by:

- Increasing the difficulty for attackers to breach systems  
- Reducing the likelihood that a single failure will compromise critical assets  
- Supporting comprehensive protection across physical, technical, and administrative domains  

---

*Implementing defense in depth helps organizations manage complex security challenges and protect sensitive information effectively.*

# Logical Access Controls

Logical access controls are **electronic mechanisms** that restrict access to systems, applications, and sometimes even physical assets or areas. Unlike physical access controls, which involve tangible barriers like locks and security guards, logical controls operate in the digital realm to ensure only authorized users gain entry.

---

## What Are Logical Access Controls?

Logical access controls limit who can access resources such as:

- Computer systems  
- Networks  
- Applications  
- Sensitive data  

Even if a person has physical access to a device or location, logical controls prevent unauthorized use of systems or information.

---

## Common Types of Logical Access Controls

- **Passwords:** The most common form of authentication requiring users to provide a secret phrase or combination of characters.  
- **Biometrics:** System-implemented recognition methods such as fingerprint scanners or facial recognition on smartphones and laptops.  
- **Badge/Token Readers:** Electronic devices that authenticate users by reading a physical badge or token connected to a system.

---

## Summary

Logical access controls are a critical component of an organization's security posture. They provide an essential layer of protection by electronically verifying identities and restricting system access to authorized users, complementing physical security measures.


# Controls and Risks

Security controls help reduce risks to a level that is acceptable to individuals or organizations. These controls can be **physical**, **administrative**, or a combination of both.

---

## Examples of Controls and Risks

### Seatbelt Example

- **Physical Control:** The seatbelt itself, which physically protects the driver.  
- **Administrative Control:** Laws that require the use of seatbelts.

Together, these controls reduce the risk of injury while driving.

---

### Bookshelf Example

- **Risk:** A tall bookshelf might topple and hurt someone.  
- **Administrative Control:** Building codes or regulations requiring the bookshelf to be secured.  
- **Physical Control:** The strap or bracket that attaches the bookshelf to the wall.

In this case, the administrative and physical controls work together to prevent injury.

---

## Summary

- A **control** reduces risk to an acceptable level.  
- Controls can be **physical** (tangible measures) or **administrative** (policies, laws, or regulations).  
- Often, both types of controls are combined to effectively manage risk.

---

*Understanding how controls relate to risks is key to managing safety and security in any environment.*

# Controls Assessments

Effective risk reduction depends on how well a control fits the current situation and adapts to changes in the environment. Assessing controls involves evaluating their appropriateness, effectiveness, and cost relative to the assets being protected.

---

## Example Scenario: Securing an Office Space for Confidential Storage

Imagine an office area being repurposed as a secure storage facility for confidential files. This area has **five doors** that need to be secured before sensitive materials can be stored.

### Key Considerations:

- **Type of Control:**  
  For maximum security, biometric scanners could be installed on all five doors.

- **Site Assessment:**  
  A thorough site assessment helps determine:
  - If all doors require biometric scanners  
  - Whether some doors can be permanently secured without electronic access  
  - If doors should be removed and replaced with permanent walls (budget permitting)

- **Cost vs. Value:**  
  The expense of implementing controls must align with the value and sensitivity of the protected information.

- **Alternative Controls:**  
  If full biometric access control is unnecessary and auditing entry is not required, simple **deadbolt locks** on all doors might provide sufficient security.

---

## Summary

Control assessments help balance:

- **Security Needs:** What level of protection is required?  
- **Cost Constraints:** What budget is available for controls?  
- **Operational Practicality:** What controls make sense given the environment and use case?

The goal is to implement controls that effectively reduce risk without excessive cost or complexity.

---

*Regular assessment and adjustment of controls ensure continued effectiveness as organizational needs and environments evolve.*

# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in the Workplace

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) assigns access privileges to employees based on their specific roles within an organization. This ensures that individuals can only access the information and systems necessary to perform their job functions.

---

## How RBAC Works

- **Role Assignments:**  
  Each employee is assigned a role that determines their access level.  
  - *Example:* Only Human Resources can access personnel files.  
  - *Example:* Only Finance can access bank accounts.  
  - *Example:* Managers can access data related to their direct reports and departments.

- **Access Granularity:**  
  High-level system administrators may have full access, while new employees start with minimal permissions required to perform their tasks.

- **Dynamic Role Management:**  
  Roles and permissions must be closely monitored and updated as job responsibilities evolve to prevent unauthorized access.

---

## Challenges with RBAC

- **Privilege Creep:**  
  Occurs when users accumulate permissions beyond what their role requires, often due to temporary access that is never revoked.  
  - *Example:* A junior employee temporarily acting as a department manager retains elevated permissions after the role change ends.

- **Complexity in Granular Roles:**  
  Managing multiple roles with different permissions requires careful oversight to ensure accuracy and security.

---

## Best Practices

- **Avoid Copying User Profiles:**  
  When hiring or changing roles, do not duplicate permissions from existing users. Instead, assign standardized roles with predefined permissions.

- **Standardize Roles:**  
  Establish clear, standard roles so new employees start with appropriate and consistent access.

- **Regular Monitoring:**  
  Continuously review and update permissions to prevent privilege creep and maintain security.

---

*Implementing RBAC effectively helps organizations secure sensitive information while providing employees with the access they need to be productive.*

# Privileged Access Management (PAM)

Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a critical security control that manages and monitors access to highly sensitive systems and data by users with elevated permissions. PAM is designed to reduce the risk of abuse or compromise of privileged accounts, which can cause significant damage when misused—either accidentally or maliciously.

---

## 🔐 What is Privileged Access?

Privileged access refers to special permissions that allow users to:
- **Create**, **read**, **update**, or **delete** critical data
- Administer operating systems, databases, and applications
- Make configuration changes or install software
- Access highly sensitive environments

These permissions are typically granted to:
- System administrators
- Network engineers
- Database administrators
- IT support staff

---

## 🧪 Real-World Scenario: ABC, Inc.

ABC, Inc. is a small company with a limited IT team responsible for system administration. To streamline their tasks, IT staff members added their user accounts to the **Domain Admins** group, giving them unrestricted access across all servers and workstations.

One day, while reviewing an email invoice, a team member inadvertently opened a **malicious attachment**. This triggered a **ransomware attack**, which quickly encrypted files across the entire environment—servers, workstations, and backups.

Because these user accounts had continuous, high-level privileges:
- The malware was able to operate with **Domain Admin** rights.
- No restrictions or triggers were in place to detect or limit the damage.
- The organization faced major operational and financial losses.

---

## ⚠️ Problem with Static Privileged Access

Without a PAM solution:
- Admin accounts are always **"on"** — 24/7, whether in use or not.
- Access control relies solely on secure logins (e.g., username and password).
- All routine tasks (like checking email) may be performed under privileged accounts, increasing exposure to threats.

---

## ✅ Just-in-Time Privileged Access

A modern PAM solution enforces **Just-in-Time (JIT)** access, where:
- Privileges are **granted temporarily**, only when needed.
- Access is **role-based**, giving users only the permissions required for a specific task.
- Elevated permissions are removed once the task is complete.
- Routine tasks are performed under **non-privileged accounts**.

This approach significantly reduces the attack surface and mitigates the impact of malware or insider threats.

---

## 🛡️ Why Privileged Access Management Matters

- **Limits Exposure:** Reduces the amount of time users have elevated permissions.
- **Minimizes Damage:** Prevents ransomware or attackers from leveraging full admin access.
- **Improves Accountability:** Tracks and audits privileged access usage.
- **Supports Compliance:** Meets security standards and regulatory requirements.

---

## 🔄 Best Practices

- Use **least privilege** principles: Only assign access necessary for the task.
- Enforce **Just-in-Time (JIT)** privilege elevation.
- Regularly **audit and review** admin roles and activity.
- Separate day-to-day tasks from admin functions using **dedicated accounts**.

---

# 🔐 Examples of Least Privilege

This document outlines real-world examples of how the **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** is applied to preserve the **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** of sensitive data.

> 🛡️ Least Privilege ensures users are granted only the minimum access necessary to perform their job responsibilities—nothing more.

---

## ✅ What is Least Privilege?

The **Principle of Least Privilege** is a security concept that restricts access rights for users, accounts, and computing processes to only those resources absolutely required to perform assigned tasks.

This helps:

- 🔒 Protect **confidential** information from unauthorized access  
- 🛠️ Maintain **integrity** by preventing unauthorized modification or deletion  
- 📈 Ensure **availability** by granting necessary access in a controlled way  

---

## 📚 Examples of Least Privilege in Practice

### 💳 Billing Department Access
- Only billing personnel can **view** consumer financial records.
- A smaller group is authorized to **edit or delete** that data.
- Ensures financial data is protected from unauthorized changes.

---

### ⏱️ Time-Based or Temporary Access
- Users may be given access:
  - For a **limited time period**
  - **During business hours** only
- Useful for contractors, auditors, or temporary project work.
- Access automatically **expires** when no longer needed.

---

### 📋 Field-Level Access
- Systems may restrict access to specific **data fields** only.
- Example: In healthcare, support staff may access **patient contact info**, but **not medical records**.
- Doctors can only access information for **their assigned patients**.
- Complies with data protection regulations like **HIPAA (USA)** or GDPR.

---

### 🔁 Role-Based Restrictions
- Access is granted based on the user's **job role**.
- Example: Developers may access staging environments but not production.
- HR personnel can access employee profiles but not payroll systems.

*Privileged accounts are high-value targets—protecting them through PAM is essential to maintaining a secure IT environment.*

# 🔐 Privileged Accounts

This document outlines the concept, usage, and risk management strategies associated with **Privileged Accounts**—those user accounts with elevated permissions beyond normal users. These accounts require stricter controls and monitoring due to the potential impact they have on the security of systems and data.

---

## 🚀 What Are Privileged Accounts?

**Privileged accounts** are user accounts that have access rights and permissions exceeding those of standard users. These accounts allow users to perform sensitive tasks such as system configuration, user management, security changes, and application control.

### 👤 Examples of Privileged Account Users

- **System Administrators**:  
  Manage operating systems, application deployment, and performance.

- **Help Desk / IT Support Staff**:  
  Perform restricted operations like password resets, account unlocks, or endpoint manipulation.

- **Security Analysts**:  
  Require access to infrastructure, endpoints, and security data across the environment.

- **Project or Client-Based Roles**:  
  Temporary elevated privileges may be granted on a per-client or per-project basis.

---

## ⚠️ Why Are Privileged Accounts High Risk?

Due to their powerful capabilities, misuse—intentional or accidental—can lead to:

- Unauthorized access to critical systems or data
- Untraceable configuration changes
- Elevated risk of internal threats
- Compliance violations

---

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation Strategies

To manage and secure privileged accounts effectively, organizations should implement the following controls:

### 📜 1. Extensive Logging and Auditing

- All actions by privileged users should be **thoroughly logged**.
- Logs serve as:
  - A **deterrent** for misuse
  - An **audit trail** for investigations
- Logs should be **reviewed regularly** and stored securely.

### 🔑 2. Stringent Access Controls

- Use **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for all users—mandatory for privileged accounts.
- Consider **Just-In-Time (JIT) access**:
  - Privileges granted only when needed
  - Automatically revoked after the task is complete

### 🧍‍♂️ 3. Trust and Background Verification

- Privileged users should undergo:
  - **Detailed background checks**
  - **Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)**
  - **Acceptable use policies**
- Ongoing or event-triggered reviews may be required based on role and risk.

### 🕵️ 4. Elevated Monitoring and Auditing

- Privileged account activity should be audited at a **higher frequency**.
- Specific tasks—like password resets or account unlocks—must be **tracked and validated**.

---

## 💡 Help Desk Example: Granular Privilege Use

In some environments (e.g., Windows domain), **domain admin** access is required for tasks like:

- Resetting user passwords  
- Unlocking user accounts

However, granting full domain admin rights is **not recommended**. Instead:

- Grant **only the necessary permissions** to perform these tasks.
- Log each password reset and verify it against Help Desk tickets.
- Automate a **daily password reset report** to cross-check with support requests.

This ensures:

- 🔄 Password issues are resolved on the first contact
- 🔐 Security is maintained by limiting exposure
- 📊 Auditing remains consistent and automated

---

## 🔎 Explore Further: Privileged Access Management (PAM)

To learn more about how to secure and manage privileged accounts, explore topics like:

- 🔐 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- ⏳ Just-In-Time Access
- 🧾 Session Recording and Review
- ⚙️ Privileged Access Management (PAM) Tools
- 🛑 Least Privilege Enforcement

---

## ✅ Summary

Privileged accounts are essential for operating and securing systems, but they also present significant risks if mismanaged. Implementing strict controls—including logging, access restrictions, and user verification—ensures that these accounts are used **safely, responsibly, and in alignment with organizational policies**.

---

# 🔄 Separation of Duties (SoD)

**Separation of Duties (SoD)**—also known as **Segregation of Duties**—is a fundamental principle of security and internal controls. It ensures that no single individual has complete control over a critical or high-risk transaction or process.

> ⚠️ SoD prevents errors, reduces the risk of fraud, and increases accountability by dividing responsibilities among multiple people.

---

## 🔑 What is Separation of Duties?

The core concept of SoD is to **split a task or process into multiple steps**, each requiring a **different individual**. This ensures that sensitive operations are not executed from start to finish by one person, protecting against abuse of power and operational mistakes.

---

## 📚 Real-World Examples

### 🧾 Invoice Approval
- **Employee A** submits an invoice (e.g., for reimbursement or vendor payment)
- **Manager B** must approve the invoice before payment is issued

This separation:
- Prevents self-authorization of payments
- Adds a review layer to detect errors or fraud

---

### ⚙️ Change Management
- **User A** submits a system configuration change request
- The request goes through:
  - **Technical review**
  - **Management approval**
- Only then is the change implemented

---

### 🔐 Dual Control (Two-Key Access)
Used in **banking or high-security scenarios**:
- A vault has **two separate locks**
- **Person A** knows one combination
- **Person B** knows the other
- 🔒 **Both must be present to access the vault**

This ensures no single person can gain access alone.

---

## 👥 Two-Person Integrity (TPI)

The **Two-Person Rule** is a variation of SoD applied to physical security and high-risk operations.

### 🚨 How It Works:
- At least **two individuals** must be present in a secure or sensitive area
- Access control systems may **deny entry to a single person**
- Used to:
  - Prevent insider threats
  - Ensure emergency support (e.g., medical issues)

### 🏥 Life Safety & Insider Threat Protection
- In critical areas (e.g., data centers, server rooms, control rooms):
  - Ensures someone is always available to assist in an emergency
  - Deters malicious activity that might occur when an individual is alone

---

## ⚠️ Collusion Risk

While SoD is effective, it's **not foolproof**. Two individuals could **collaborate maliciously** to override the protections SoD provides.

> This type of threat is known as **collusion**.

Mitigating collusion requires:
- Regular **audits**
- Strong **monitoring**
- Well-defined **incident response plans**

---

---

## 🛠️ Related Controls

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  Assigns access based on clearly defined roles

- **Least Privilege Principle**  
  Users only have access to what they need—nothing more

- **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**  
  Secures and monitors the use of elevated privileges

---
# 🛡️ Authorized vs Unauthorized Personnel

This document outlines how access control is enforced within secure environments by distinguishing between **authorized** and **unauthorized** personnel. Access decisions are based on **authentication**, **authorization**, and appropriate **provisioning** of user accounts and privileges.

---

## 🔐 Authentication and Authorization

### 🧾 Definitions

- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user (subject).
- **Authorization**: Determining whether the authenticated user has the rights to perform a specific action or access a specific resource (object).

Once a subject has been authenticated, the system checks its **authorization** before allowing access to the requested resource or action.

---

## 📋 Real-World Examples

### 🔒 Physical Access Example
When a user scans their **ID badge** at a secure facility entrance:

- The system verifies the **badge ID** against an internal **security matrix**.
- If **authorized**, the door unlocks.
- If **unauthorized**, the door remains locked.

### 🗑️ File Deletion Example
When a user tries to delete a file:

- The file system checks the user's **file permissions**.
- If **authorized**, the file is deleted.
- If **unauthorized**, an error is returned and the file remains unchanged.

---

## 👥 User Provisioning Lifecycle

Provisioning users properly is crucial for maintaining a secure access control environment. This involves creating, updating, or removing user accounts and privileges based on employment status and role changes.

### ➕ New Employee Onboarding

- The **hiring manager** submits a request to the **security administrator** to create a new user account.
- Access levels are assigned based on the employee’s job function.
- **Additional authorization** is required for elevated access.

### 🔁 Role or Position Change

- When an employee is **promoted or moved**:
  - New access rights are granted based on the new role.
  - Old permissions that are no longer relevant are **revoked**.
- Prevents **privilege creep** and aligns access with job duties.

### ➖ Termination of Employment

- Upon separation:
  - The user account is **disabled** immediately.
  - After a grace period (for audit trail retention), the account may be **deleted**.
  - Access is removed from all **security roles** and **group memberships**.

> ⚠️ Terminated accounts should be disabled immediately to prevent unauthorized access, even if deletion is delayed for audit and forensic purposes.

---

## 🚫 Avoiding Privilege Creep

A common pitfall in access provisioning is **copying existing user profiles** when creating new accounts. This can unintentionally propagate excessive or outdated permissions.

### ❌ Problem:
- User A is temporarily granted extra access to perform a one-time task.
- Their account is later copied to create User B.
- User B now has access they **do not need**, possibly creating a security risk.

### ✅ Solution:
- Use **standardized roles** and **access templates**.
- Provision new users based on **defined job roles**, not cloned profiles.
- Regularly **review and update** permissions to reflect current responsibilities.

---

## ✅ Best Practices Summary

| Practice | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔐 Authenticate users | Confirm user identity before allowing access |
| 📊 Authorize based on roles | Grant only necessary access per job function |
| 🧑‍💼 Role-based provisioning | Use standardized roles for new accounts |
| 🧹 Remove unused access | Revoke unnecessary privileges during role changes |
| ❌ Disable upon exit | Immediately disable accounts when users leave |
| 🧾 Audit trails | Preserve logs for compliance and investigations |
| 🔄 Periodic reviews | Regularly review roles and access for accuracy |

# 🔐 Types of Physical Access Controls

Physical access control mechanisms are essential for controlling, monitoring, and managing access to facilities. These controls vary widely—from deterrents to detection systems—and must be tailored to the unique requirements of different physical areas, including both perimeter and internal security zones.

---

## 🚪 Common Types of Physical Access Controls

### Badge Systems and Gate Entry  
Access control systems typically use badges assigned through enrollment stations. These badges carry employee identifiers and define the areas accessible to each individual. When a badge is scanned, the system verifies it against a database and, if authorized, allows entry through doors or gates. These systems usually log all access attempts—both authorized and unauthorized.

Badge types include:  
- Bar Code  
- Proximity  
- Hybrid  
- Magnetic Stripe  
- Smart Cards  

---

### 🏢 Environmental Design (CPTED)  
**Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED)** promotes safer workplaces using passive design strategies such as architectural layout, natural surveillance, and controlled circulation flow. These design elements help guide human behavior, reduce hidden areas, and discourage criminal activity. Security professionals use CPTED principles to create functional and secure physical environments where information is handled.

---

### 🧬 Biometrics  
Biometric authentication uses unique physiological or behavioral characteristics for identity verification. It involves two main processes:  

- **Enrollment:** The user’s biometric data is captured and stored in a system or on a smart card.  
- **Verification:** The user presents biometric data (e.g., fingerprint, iris scan) to the system, which compares it against the stored record to authenticate identity.

#### Types of Biometric Systems:  
- **Physiological:** Fingerprint, iris scan, retinal scan, palm scan, venous scan  
- **Behavioral:** Voiceprint, signature dynamics, keystroke dynamics  

Biometrics are highly accurate but often costly to implement and maintain. Privacy concerns and sanitization challenges must be addressed to ensure user trust and hygiene.

---

## ⚠️ Considerations and Challenges

- Biometric data is personally identifiable information (PII) and must be protected carefully.  
- Users may resist biometric systems due to privacy or medical concerns.  
- Environmental and design controls require collaboration between security and facilities teams.  
- Badge systems must be managed diligently to avoid misuse or duplication.

# Monitoring

Monitoring is a crucial component of any physical security program. It encompasses a variety of tools and processes designed to deter, detect, record, and respond to unauthorized activities within an organization’s physical environment.

---

## 🔎 Key Monitoring Components

### Cameras  
Surveillance cameras are commonly integrated into security systems and centrally monitored. They serve as a deterrent, help detect suspicious activities when paired with sensors, and provide forensic evidence if incidents occur. Cameras are particularly valuable in hard-to-access locations or areas requiring a detailed activity record.

---

### 📜 Logs  
Physical security logs document events such as visitor sign-ins, access attempts, or system-generated entries. Logs support business and legal requirements, helping with compliance and forensic investigations. Protecting logs from manipulation and unauthorized access is essential, and organizations should implement policies for regular review and retention.

---

### 🚨 Alarm Systems  
Alarm systems alert personnel to unexpected access attempts or emergencies. Examples include:  
- Door/window alarms triggered by forced entry  
- Fire alarms activated by smoke or heat sensors  
- Panic buttons that notify security or police immediately  

These systems act as early warnings to prevent damage or respond rapidly.

---

### 👮 Security Guards  
Security personnel provide a physical presence that deters unauthorized entry and assists in monitoring access points. Guards can prevent tailgating (unauthorized following through secured doors) and verify identities when needed, complementing technological controls.

---

### 🌐 Additional Sensors  
Motion detectors (infrared, microwave, laser), vibration sensors, and strain-sensitive cables enhance perimeter security by detecting intrusion attempts such as fence climbing or unauthorized entry across open spaces.

---

## 📝 Log Management and Anomalies

- Logs must be retained according to legal and business requirements, often dictated by regulations like PCI DSS or federal laws.  
- Excessive logging can overwhelm resources; organizations should strike a balance.  
- Log anomalies (e.g., missing timestamps, unexpected lockouts) are often the first indicators of security incidents and must be actively monitored.  

---

# 🔐 Logical Access Controls

Logical access controls are **electronic security mechanisms** used to manage access to digital systems, applications, data, and in some cases, even physical assets. Unlike physical access controls, which restrict physical entry to locations or objects, logical access controls govern who can interact with **digital resources**, and how.

---

## 💻 What Are Logical Access Controls?

Logical access controls help **restrict unauthorized users** from accessing information systems, even if they already have physical access to the device or environment. These controls work by **verifying identity and enforcing access rules** through electronic means.

---

## 🛠️ Common Types of Logical Access Controls

### 🔑 Passwords
The most basic and widely used form of logical control. Passwords act as a first line of defense by validating user identity. Strong password policies, complexity requirements, and periodic changes are key components of secure password implementation.

### 🧬 Biometrics
Biometric systems authenticate users based on **unique physical or behavioral traits** such as fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans, or voice patterns. Commonly implemented on smartphones, laptops, and high-security systems.

### 🪪 Badge or Token Readers
Badge or token-based systems use **smart cards, proximity badges, or USB tokens** that interface with a system to grant access. These are typically paired with PINs or biometric verification for **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.

---

## 🔐 Logical vs. Physical Access Controls

| Access Control Type | Description | Examples |
|---------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Physical**         | Restricts physical access to locations or assets | Security guards, doors, fences, gates |
| **Logical**          | Restricts access to systems and data | Passwords, biometrics, access tokens |

---

# 🔐 Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

**Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** is a type of access control policy that allows the **owner of an object** (such as a file or folder) to determine who is allowed access and what type of access they are granted. DAC is widely used across various operating systems and platforms.

DAC systems rely on the **discretion of the owner** to manage access permissions, making it flexible but also less secure and harder to scale than other models such as Mandatory Access Control (MAC).

---

## 🛠️ Key Features of DAC

- Users (subjects) can **grant permissions** to other users.
- Permissions can include:
  - 🔄 Read
  - ✏️ Write
  - ▶️ Execute
- Users may also:
  - Pass information to other users or systems.
  - Modify security attributes of owned objects.
  - Grant privileges to other users for owned resources.
  - Set access permissions for newly created objects.

---

## 📊 DAC Access Control Table Example

|            | Excel File 1         | Excel File 2         |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Aidan**  | Read, Write, Execute | Read, Execute        |
| **Steve**  | Read                 | Read, Write          |

### 📋 Aidan's Capability List
- Excel File 1: Read, Write, Execute
- Excel File 2: Read, Execute

### 📋 Access Control List (ACL) for Excel File 1
- Aidan: Read, Write, Execute
- Steve: Read

---

## 🖥️ Real-World Examples

- **Operating Systems**: UNIX/Linux, Windows, and macOS implement DAC by allowing users to set file and folder permissions.
- **Cloud Storage**: In platforms like Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive, users can share a file or folder and specify view/edit permissions.
- **Low-Tech DAC**: A temporary visitor badge issued at a front desk — granted at the discretion of the receptionist.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations of DAC

- **Not Scalable**: Each object’s permissions are managed by individual users, leading to potential chaos in large organizations.
- **Hard to Audit**: Tracing the origin of permissions or resolving access issues can be complex.
- **Vulnerable to Insider Threats**: Since users can grant access freely, sensitive information might be shared inappropriately.
