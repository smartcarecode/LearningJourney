# ISC2 NOTES

## üåü Progress Update: Today‚Äôs Learning Achievement

Today, I dedicated focused time to deeply study and understand the **CIA Triad** ‚Äî the core foundation of information security.  
This principle of **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability** is vital for protecting data in any environment.

I‚Äôm excited to have grasped these concepts clearly, and I‚Äôm committed to building on this knowledge every day.  
This marks an important step in my journey toward becoming a skilled cybersecurity professional.

Continuous learning and growth are my priorities, and I‚Äôm motivated to keep pushing forward with discipline and passion.

# üîê The CIA Triad: Fundamental Principles of Information Security

The **CIA Triad** defines the three core goals to protect information systems:

- **Confidentiality:** Keep data private and secure.  
- **Integrity:** Ensure data is accurate and trustworthy.  
- **Availability:** Make data and systems accessible when needed.

---

## üîí Confidentiality

1. Grant access **only to authorized users**.  
2. Block **unauthorized access** effectively.  
3. Use **strong passwords** and **multi-factor authentication**.  
4. Protect data with **encryption**.  
5. Limit access based on **user roles**.  
6. Train employees on **data privacy best practices**.  
7. Log and monitor **data access activities**.  
8. Label sensitive data as **confidential**.  
9. Avoid sharing data over **public or unsecured networks**.  
10. Ensure policies prevent **data leakage or exposure**.

**Example:** Nurses can view patient records; cleaning staff cannot.

---

## üßæ Integrity

1. Maintain data **accuracy and consistency**.  
2. Prevent **unauthorized data modifications**.  
3. Use tools to **detect changes or tampering**.  
4. Keep detailed **logs of all data changes**.  
5. Perform **regular backups**.  
6. Allow edits by **trusted personnel only**.  
7. Regularly check data for **errors or inconsistencies**.  
8. Follow strict **change control procedures**.  
9. Use **digital signatures** for data verification.  
10. Verify data sources to ensure **authenticity**.

**Example:** Lab results remain unaltered unless properly updated.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Availability

1. Ensure systems and data are **accessible when needed**.  
2. Resolve issues **promptly to reduce downtime**.  
3. Use **backup systems** to maintain service during failures.  
4. Perform regular **system maintenance and updates**.  
5. Defend against attacks that **disrupt service**.  
6. Monitor system health for early issue detection.  
7. Maintain **backup power sources** like generators.  
8. Prepare **disaster recovery plans**.  
9. Design systems to support **high user demand**.  
10. Protect hardware from **damage or theft**.

**Example:** Hospital IT systems run continuously, 24/7.

Privacy and Data Protection Overview
In today‚Äôs digital world, personal information is collected, stored, and used by many organizations. Protecting this information is crucial to respecting individuals‚Äô rights and maintaining trust. Privacy allows people to control how their data is shared and used, while data protection laws set rules to ensure organizations handle data responsibly. This guide covers important concepts and key laws that businesses need to know to stay compliant and protect privacy effectively.

1. Privacy Meaning
Privacy refers to the individual‚Äôs ability to control who accesses their personal information and how that information is used or shared.

2. Privacy vs. Security
Privacy is about controlling access to personal data and ensuring it is used properly.

Security involves technical measures that protect data from unauthorized access, theft, or damage.

3. More Data Being Collected
With the rise of digital services, more personal data is gathered every day, increasing the risk of misuse and breaches if privacy is not properly maintained.

4. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ‚Äì 2016
This landmark European Union law, effective from 2018, provides individuals with strong rights over their personal data. It requires organizations worldwide to protect the data of EU residents and be transparent about how it is used.

5. GDPR Applies Worldwide
GDPR‚Äôs reach extends beyond the EU. Any organization, regardless of location, that processes the personal data of people in the EU must comply with its requirements.

6. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) ‚Äì 2018
This U.S. state law, effective from 2020, gives California residents the right to know what personal data businesses collect about them, request deletion, and opt out of data selling.

7. California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) ‚Äì 2020
Building upon the CCPA, this law took effect in 2023 and adds stronger privacy protections, including new consumer rights and the creation of a state agency dedicated to privacy enforcement.

8. Follow Local Privacy Laws
Businesses must comply with privacy regulations wherever their customers or users live. This can mean navigating multiple laws when operating internationally.

9. Security Alone Is Not Enough
Protecting data from cyber threats is essential, but organizations must also be transparent, obtain consent, and use data lawfully to fully respect privacy.

10. Consequences of Breaking Privacy Laws
Failure to comply with privacy laws can result in hefty fines, legal action, and damage to reputation, which can erode customer trust and harm business success.
