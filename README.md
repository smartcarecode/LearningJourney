# Non-Repudiation

---

## Overview

Non-repudiation is a crucial security principle that ensures a person or entity **cannot deny** having performed a specific digital action. It provides **undeniable proof** of data origin and delivery, making it impossible to falsely deny involvement in transactions or communications.

With the rise of electronic transactions and digital communication, non-repudiation builds trust, enforces accountability, and supports legal compliance.

---

## Why Non-Repudiation Matters

In digital systems, actions happen remotely and quickly. Without non-repudiation, users could deny their actions, leading to fraud, disputes, and legal issues.

**Non-repudiation helps to:**

- Protect all parties by providing clear evidence of actions  
- Reduce fraud and impersonation  
- Enforce electronic contracts and agreements  
- Build confidence in digital platforms  

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Prevents Denial  
Stops users from denying digital actions (e.g., online purchases).

### 2. Legal Evidence  
Digital signatures and logs serve as evidence in courts.

### 3. Action Tracking  
Logs record who did what and when, creating an audit trail.

### 4. Identity Verification  
Digital signatures and certificates confirm true user identities.

### 5. Builds Trust and Accountability  
Makes digital actions traceable and verifiable, increasing trust.

---

## Common Applications

- **Digital Signatures:** Authenticate and verify documents and messages  
- **Online Transactions:** Record payment details to prevent fraud  
- **Secure Email:** Verify sender authenticity using cryptographic signatures  
- **Audit Logs:** Track user activity for compliance and forensic analysis  
- **E-Government Services:** Ensure transparency and legal integrity in citizen requests  

---

## How Non-Repudiation Works

Non-repudiation typically relies on:

- **Cryptographic Techniques:** Digital signatures and hashing ensure integrity and authenticity  
- **Timestamping:** Records the exact time of actions  
- **Authentication Mechanisms:** Strong identity verification (passwords, biometrics, certificates)  
- **Audit Trails:** Detailed logs for future verification  

---

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Key Management:** Secure storage and handling of cryptographic keys  
- **System Integrity:** Prevent tampering with logs and signatures  
- **User Privacy:** Balance transparency with privacy protections  
- **Legal Compliance:** Follow local laws and regulations  

---

## Conclusion

Non-repudiation is essential for trustworthy and secure digital interactions. It protects businesses, governments, and individuals by ensuring actions are verifiable and cannot be denied.

# Decision Making Based on Risk Priorities

When managing risks, organizations must carefully evaluate several factors:

**1. Likelihood of the Risk**  
How likely is the risk to happen?

**2. Impact of the Risk**  
What would be the severity of the consequences if the risk occurs?

**3. Risk Tolerance**  
How much risk is the organization willing to accept or ignore?

**4. Location-Specific Risks**  
- Companies in different places face different risks.  
- Example: A company in Hawaii worries more about volcanic eruptions.  
- Example: A company in Chicago focuses on blizzards (severe snowstorms with heavy snow and strong winds that make travel dangerous).

**5. Decision Makers**  
Executive management and the board of directors decide the organization's risk tolerance.

**6. Consequences of Ignoring Risks**  
Ignoring serious risks, such as exposing workers to asbestos, can lead to significant legal and financial trouble.
