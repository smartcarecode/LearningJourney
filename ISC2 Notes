# ISC2 NOTES

## 🌟 Progress Update: Today’s Learning Achievement

Today, I dedicated focused time to deeply study and understand the **CIA Triad** — the core foundation of information security.  
This principle of **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability** is vital for protecting data in any environment.

I’m excited to have grasped these concepts clearly, and I’m committed to building on this knowledge every day.  
This marks an important step in my journey toward becoming a skilled cybersecurity professional.

Continuous learning and growth are my priorities, and I’m motivated to keep pushing forward with discipline and passion.

# 🔐 The CIA Triad: Fundamental Principles of Information Security

The **CIA Triad** defines the three core goals to protect information systems:

- **Confidentiality:** Keep data private and secure.  
- **Integrity:** Ensure data is accurate and trustworthy.  
- **Availability:** Make data and systems accessible when needed.

---

## 🔒 Confidentiality

1. Grant access **only to authorized users**.  
2. Block **unauthorized access** effectively.  
3. Use **strong passwords** and **multi-factor authentication**.  
4. Protect data with **encryption**.  
5. Limit access based on **user roles**.  
6. Train employees on **data privacy best practices**.  
7. Log and monitor **data access activities**.  
8. Label sensitive data as **confidential**.  
9. Avoid sharing data over **public or unsecured networks**.  
10. Ensure policies prevent **data leakage or exposure**.

**Example:** Nurses can view patient records; cleaning staff cannot.

---

## 🧾 Integrity

1. Maintain data **accuracy and consistency**.  
2. Prevent **unauthorized data modifications**.  
3. Use tools to **detect changes or tampering**.  
4. Keep detailed **logs of all data changes**.  
5. Perform **regular backups**.  
6. Allow edits by **trusted personnel only**.  
7. Regularly check data for **errors or inconsistencies**.  
8. Follow strict **change control procedures**.  
9. Use **digital signatures** for data verification.  
10. Verify data sources to ensure **authenticity**.

**Example:** Lab results remain unaltered unless properly updated.

---

## ⚙️ Availability

1. Ensure systems and data are **accessible when needed**.  
2. Resolve issues **promptly to reduce downtime**.  
3. Use **backup systems** to maintain service during failures.  
4. Perform regular **system maintenance and updates**.  
5. Defend against attacks that **disrupt service**.  
6. Monitor system health for early issue detection.  
7. Maintain **backup power sources** like generators.  
8. Prepare **disaster recovery plans**.  
9. Design systems to support **high user demand**.  
10. Protect hardware from **damage or theft**.

**Example:** Hospital IT systems run continuously, 24/7.

| Principle       | Focus                     | Example                                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Confidentiality | Protect data privacy       | Nurses access records; cleaners do not.  |
| Integrity       | Ensure data accuracy       | Lab results remain unchanged unless valid.|

Privacy and Data Protection
1. Privacy Meaning
Privacy is when you control who can see and use your personal information.

2. Privacy vs. Security
Privacy: Who can access and use your data.

Security: Protecting data from hackers and leaks.

3. More Data Being Collected
More personal data is gathered online, so privacy rules are important.

4. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – 2016
EU law passed in 2016, started in 2018.
Gives people control over their data and sets rules for companies.

5. GDPR Applies Worldwide
Any company handling data from EU people must follow GDPR, no matter where it is.

6. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) – 2018
California law passed in 2018, active from 2020.
Gives Californians rights to know and control their personal data.

7. California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) – 2020
Updated and expanded CCPA in 2020, effective 2023.
Adds stronger privacy protections and enforcement.

8. Follow Local Privacy Laws
Businesses must obey privacy laws of every country or state where they collect data.

9. Security Alone Is Not Enough
Companies must also get permission and be clear about how they use data.

10. Consequences of Breaking Privacy Laws
Fines, lawsuits, and loss of customer trust can happen if laws are broken.

# Non-Repudiation

---

## Overview

Non-repudiation is a crucial security principle that ensures a person or entity **cannot deny** having performed a specific digital action. It provides **undeniable proof** of data origin and delivery, making it impossible to falsely deny involvement in transactions or communications.

With the rise of electronic transactions and digital communication, non-repudiation builds trust, enforces accountability, and supports legal compliance.

---

## Why Non-Repudiation Matters

In digital systems, actions happen remotely and quickly. Without non-repudiation, users could deny their actions, leading to fraud, disputes, and legal issues.

**Non-repudiation helps to:**

- Protect all parties by providing clear evidence of actions  
- Reduce fraud and impersonation  
- Enforce electronic contracts and agreements  
- Build confidence in digital platforms  

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Prevents Denial  
Stops users from denying digital actions (e.g., online purchases).

### 2. Legal Evidence  
Digital signatures and logs serve as evidence in courts.

### 3. Action Tracking  
Logs record who did what and when, creating an audit trail.

### 4. Identity Verification  
Digital signatures and certificates confirm true user identities.

### 5. Builds Trust and Accountability  
Makes digital actions traceable and verifiable, increasing trust.

---

## Common Applications

- **Digital Signatures:** Authenticate and verify documents and messages  
- **Online Transactions:** Record payment details to prevent fraud  
- **Secure Email:** Verify sender authenticity using cryptographic signatures  
- **Audit Logs:** Track user activity for compliance and forensic analysis  
- **E-Government Services:** Ensure transparency and legal integrity in citizen requests  

---

## How Non-Repudiation Works

Non-repudiation typically relies on:

- **Cryptographic Techniques:** Digital signatures and hashing ensure integrity and authenticity  
- **Timestamping:** Records the exact time of actions  
- **Authentication Mechanisms:** Strong identity verification (passwords, biometrics, certificates)  
- **Audit Trails:** Detailed logs for future verification  

---

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Key Management:** Secure storage and handling of cryptographic keys  
- **System Integrity:** Prevent tampering with logs and signatures  
- **User Privacy:** Balance transparency with privacy protections  
- **Legal Compliance:** Follow local laws and regulations  

---

## Conclusion

Non-repudiation is essential for trustworthy and secure digital interactions. It protects businesses, governments, and individuals by ensuring actions are verifiable and cannot be denied.

Risk Management in Cybersecurity
Important concepts to understand how organizations protect their digital assets:

1. Asset
Anything valuable that needs protection to keep the organization safe.
Example: Customer data, company computers, or software applications.

2. Vulnerability
A weakness or gap in security that could be exploited by a threat.
Example: Using weak passwords or failing to update software regularly.

3. Threat
Anything that can cause harm by exploiting a vulnerability.
Example: Hackers, viruses, or phishing emails.

4. Risk
The chance that a threat will exploit a vulnerability and cause harm.
Example: The possibility that a hacker will break into an outdated system.

5. Risk Assessment
The process of identifying risks, evaluating their likelihood, and potential impact.
Example: Analyzing which systems are most likely to be attacked and what damage could result.

6. Using Risk Data
Using information about past incidents and current threats to prioritize security efforts.
Example: Focusing on improving email security after an increase in phishing attacks.

7. Collaboration
Different teams working together to manage and reduce risks effectively.
Example: IT working with HR to train employees about safe online behavior.

8. Reporting
Communicating clear and actionable information about risks to decision-makers.
Example: Providing monthly security reports to company leadership.

9. Monitoring
Continuously observing systems and networks to detect new threats or weaknesses early.
Example: Using security software to track suspicious activity on company computers.

10. Improvement
Learning from incidents and regularly updating security measures to stay protected.
Example: Updating security policies after a data breach to prevent future attacks.
